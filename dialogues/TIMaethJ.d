Some define 'pure' as being true to one's vows at the time that they were made...hence, celibacy for those who are not virgins.~

=~Cýrontîr followed Corellon Larethian because he was from Evermeet and had grown up in the big Grove of Corellon there. Our larger community. Suldanessellar, was also an early influence. It is ruled by Queen Ellesime, who was said to be the daughter of Rillifane Rallathil. I, consequently, initially sought to serve the God of the forests as his cleric and trained at the temple of Rillifane in Sudanessellar.~
=~But then, of course, came the attack. After the healers took care of my immediate injuries, but before I was out of bed, I was asked to consider what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Sir Tybalt had noted my unusual strength, so he wanted me to do what he had done; train as a paladin and become an Order Knight. I felt no calling from his deity, Tyr, however, so I thought I would end up serving Vandria Gilmadrith, Corellon's daughter since I heard there were a few Knights of hers in Trademeet.~
=~But then, Tyb introduced me to his friend, Sir Finnilithui, a knight-errant who served at the headquarters of the Order of the Radiant Heart as an associate member and as liasion for several of the major Orders of Elven Knights. I have never felt such immediate kinship to anyone before or since and Finn felt much the same way. *Maethor sighs.* He was close to leblû haran...five hundred of your years... Anyway, Finn initiated me as a Blade.

With the whole family dead and the military divided into factions, the common folk were left to speculate about their future.~

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack; some living in the countryside discovered their farmhands armed and pounding on their manor doors in those days.~
=~And, royalist plots aside, the common folk always assumed the elves of Tethir must have been involved. Localized violence turned into raging forest fires and unorganized warparties.

She did not want them interfering in her life and she wasn't really concerned about cost.

SAY ~Among my people it is referred to as 'The Ten Black Days of Eleint.' Prince Alemander of Tethyr deposed his father, Alemander IV, with the help of the peasantry. However, his plan backfired when his trusted ally, General Sharboneth, betrayed him and arranged for a fire to be set that would trap the Prince in the castle. With the whole family dead and the military divided into factions, the common folk were left to speculate about their future.~
=~As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos and anti-royalist sentiment. For ten days, anyone suspected of intimate connection to the royal family was put to the sword. The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack; some living in the countryside discovered their farmhands armed and pounding on their manor doors in those days.~
=~And, royalist plots aside, the common folk always assumed the elves of Tethir must have been involved. Localized violence turned into raging forest fires and unorganized warparties. I don't know who brought up the subject of leaving, first, Naneth or Cýrontîr, but once the topic was broached, we had long arguments over whether it was the best option. There was no question that Naneth and I would leave.~
=~Naneth's patrons were telling her that it was dangerous to live so close to Adan and that her lack of distinction in who she'd take as a customer would come back to punish her.  So Cýrontîr arranged through his connections at court for us to be accompanied by an armed guard.~

SAY ~It was. It's strange to me that of all those who claimed to love my mother, only Cýr and me would willingly face danger with her. I've mentioned that Naneth always had several exceptionally tolerant lovers...she called them her 'favorites'...staying at our house. Most of them were like obnoxious guests; you know, the kind who eat too much, drink too much, stay up carousing and singing too late in the evenings and leave a mess behind.~
=~They'd show up, hang around for a night or two to enjoy Naneth's company, and then go back to their other lives. Cýrontîr was the only one who actually lived with us. Naneth used to tease him and say he was my real nana, but she conveniently forgot that she'd brought him home with that purpose in mind. *Maethor points up at the sky, outlining the faint curve of the moon.* Whenever I can see the moon and the Tears during the day I think about Cýrontîr.~
=~That's what his name means: 'Looks at the moon.'. He was a scribe for the royal treasury, but he told me once he hoped to work in Ellesime's court as an astronomer. At night, when Naneth would go out to amuse some patron of hers, he would take care of me. He would feed me, brush and braid my hair, give me my bath, dress me in my nightgown... that sort of thing. Frankly, he was better at it than Naneth. When he would put me to bed, he didn't just expect me to fall asleep--he would tell me stories from one of his big books and talk to me.~

Or any of the dozen others who stayed with us on occasion. Naneth's constant need for lively company was probably one of the reasons he had lodgings at Court. Most of his belongings were stored in a small room off the kitchen and his favorite chair for reverie was a permanent fixture on our roof, but he would have needed a place to escape to.~
= ~Unlike any of my mother's other lovers, he was constantly attempting to get her to change. When he would drink, he'd speak his mind openly. Then they would have terrible fights. They would argue, she would storm out, and he would yell after her not to expect him to be at home when she came back. *sigh* They both knew that was an empty threat. No matter how long she'd been gone, he would not leave. Tybalt arranged to send his body back to his family in Evermeet, so I suppose he did escape in the end.~

=~She was beaten so severely that her face and body were unrecognizable. *Maethor shakes his head to clear the memory.* I doubt we would have been much safer remaining at home, however. Many of our former neighbors died in the raging forest fires the edain set. That or were cut down trying to flee. We were too close to the edge of the wood and too far away to expect protection from Suldanessellar.~

Milui, for one. But he was an orphan who lived and worked at one of the Queen's stables. Noone cared whether he would play with me. Having a courtesan for a mother guaranteed that almost all of the other children I knew weren't allowed to play with me. There was too much unspoken fear that I'd grow up to be just like her and corrupt all those young lads and lasses.~

The hardest part of it all is knowing that she meant to sell me one way or another all along.~
=~Naneth's worst cruelty lay in how she coldly assessed the value of those close to her. The keeping of a willing concubine is something my people do not like to admit to, but it occurs amongst the wealthy and powerful. I was valuable to her. Even Cýrontîr accepted that he would have to buy my freedom. When we left for Amn later, the matter was still not resolved.

It meant that I have only a handful of episodes to regret. There were a few nights that Cýrontîr was required to stay at Court late, leaving me alone with my mother, her friends, and her perversity. And there were a few nights when drink interfered with his ability to protect me.~

Cýrontîr eventually came looking for him, of course, but by then Hargam had had time to take me in his arms and wake me up with kisses.

When he tilts my face up and looks in my eyes, I fear what he will ask at the same time as I yearn for his requests.~
=~He taught me many ways of playing while...while leaving my virginity untouched. Days rush ahead and Angharradh's blessing continues to bring me a cycle of blood for each year. I reached womanhood early, well ahead of the other girls born the same year, but Naneth still has to take up the hems of every dress... It seems I will never reach her height. 'You shall be a little warrior, Maeth-weg,' says Cýrontîr, 'No matter. I enjoy carrying you.'~
=~When Nightul came to a close, Cýr, my mother, and I celebrated the day I was begotten and crowned me with flowers. But after, Naneth and Cýrontîr foght more viciously than I'd ever seen before. Naneth has a new favorite... a young soldier nick-named Hador... and wants to introduce him to one of her military patrons. Not only will Hador advance more quickly as an officer, but he will also enjoy other pleasures in my mother's company. So he is more than willing to indulge her stranger tastes.~
=~But Cýrontîr isn't willing. And won't. Not for yet another rival. When she whispers some perverse suggestion to him, he refuses her cosseting and calls her a name I won't repeat. She strikes him across the face. He moves to grab her, but finds Hador in his way. They scuffle, but Cýr gets the worst of it.~
=~Naneth finally pulls Hador away and shoves him toward the entry hall. She casts one last ugly glare at Cýr, nursing his bruises, and then has departed. I wonder helplessly if she'll even return... We have need of her, I think, but she has no need for us... For the first time, Cýrontîr does not wait for me to sleep, kissing and embracing me even as he carries me to her bed. He has not even been drinking.~
=~As he undresses me, piece by piece, I have no way of continuing to pretend that the man who cared for me and the man who carries me to Naneth's bed are different. He kisses the point at my throat where my blood pounds the hardest and then sits back, unlacing his breeches. He strips, and there's little of his accustomed good humor now. I'm startled to find him already ready for me.~
=~When he lays down beside me, I take him in my palms and lower my face... But he stops me and takes my hands away: 'Al si!' Then he speaks, carefully and directly, as if he fears I won't understand: 'Nasta i 'wib nîn ned i huch gîn aníron, Maethor lend. I vaur cin puhta gauron.' He wants my virginity. He has need to take me... So...~

=~I begged him to please himself quickly. To end it. He stopped entirely, watching me. 'Why are you looking at me?' 'I need to please you. To see your expression as you tremble and cry out. I don't want this to just be for me.' He held me afterwards, whispering how much he loved me. That he sometimes wished to openly be my man and get me with child.

The third morning, I began to cry because I thought she wasn't coming back. He held me and told me he'd go out to find her. That he'd bring her back. But I wouldn't let him leave because then I'd be alone.~
=~Between our vigils, we tried to construct daily life. Cooking together. Cleaning house together; opening the windows and sweeping the floors. We played music together. Tossed dice. He showed me the stars, telling me their names and outlining constellations.~
=~And we played at púcë. Not always gently. He carried the marks of my nails down his back and I wore bruises from his fingers on my wrists like bracelets. I'm not sure what we would have done if she'd decided to leave us. It had always been clear that she held the reins to the harness that kept us together. Without her presence, I felt anxious and lost. Fortunately, she did come home.~
=~I am sure she was puzzled to see my boots, my Temple knapsack, and Cýrontîr's cloak still in their accustomed places by the door. She must have looked all through the house for us, perhaps pausing at the sheets drying in the sun, because she came up the ladder to check on the roof.~

He did not go to Court to work those days and he chased away the messenger that my tutors at the Temple sent. threatening to beat him senseless. The third morning, I began to cry because I thought she wasn't coming back. He held me and told me he'd go out to find her. That he'd bring her back. But I wouldn't let him leave because then I'd be alone.~
=~Between our vigils, we tried to construct daily life. Cooking together. Cleaning house together; opening the windows and sweeping the floors. We played music together. Tossed dice. He showed me the stars, telling me their names and outlining constellations.~
=~And we played at púcë. Not always gently. He carried the marks of my nails down his back and I wore bruises from his fingers on my wrists like bracelets. I'm not sure what we would have done if she'd decided to leave us. It had always been clear that she held the reins to the harness that kept us together. Without her presence, I felt anxious and lost. Fortunately, she did come home.~
=~I am sure she was puzzled to see my boots, my Temple knapsack, and Cýrontîr's cloak still in their accustomed places by the door. She must have looked all through the house for us, perhaps pausing at the sheets drying in the sun, because she came up the ladder to check on the roof.~
=~She was afraid of heights, you see, and had never come up there before, choosing instead to merely open up the trap and call to us. Naneth emerging through the trap was very unexpected. When I saw her, I startled and fell backwards off of Cýr's lap.~
