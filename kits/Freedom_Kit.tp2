SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by 'protection from evil'.  It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~ // unidentified description for items, spell description for spells

SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet from the caster's hand.  The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can damage, though the bonus does not apply to THAC0.  In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from strength do not apply. The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage, and an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible.  A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~ // unidentified description for items, spell description for spells

Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks (such as fireball or curse).  This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless himself.
