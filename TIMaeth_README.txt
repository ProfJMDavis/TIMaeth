Maethor Grenfell, Alpha Version 1.0, is currently an NPC only for BGT, although I hope to complete the cross-platforming work I've started. She probably should be installed after other WEIDU NPC's.

Maethor Grenfell's speaks Tolkien's Elvish language "Sindarin." Translations follow:

I: "Sindarin"

C: From Banters

   1: Coran
      Man i eneth gîn? (He's using the intimate form of "you"... What one might expect from Coran talking to a woman he finds attractive.)
      What is your name?

      Suilaid.
      Greetings

      Ai. Cened i thraw gîn, nin moel panna. Hanali, ae nin melog, natha trehell a nin dinin andaw.
      Wow. Seeing your body, lust fills me. Hanali, if you love me, she will be naked and under me by night.

      Ci leich
      You're sweet.

      'Evennog:' Nadû i nîf gîn cennin. Morn i chîn gîn sui i venel. Guren nîn i gam gîn gant. Sui flâd nîn mathanner. Cin mathad aníron. Laugas gîn bo i thraw nîn. Dan sui adtôl daw...Evennog.*
      'You Have Gone:' I saw your face at night. Black were your eyes like the sky. Your hands held my heart as they touched my skin. I want to feel you. Your warmth on my body. But as night comes again, you have gone.*

      Thandas gin aníron mathad
      Truly I want to feel you.

      Meletheg
      My love (it's used here as an intimate nick-name)

      îr enni horthog iston
      I know you have sexual desire for me.

      îr anlen
      Desire for you? (In contrast to Coran, who jumps immediately to the informal "you" in order the enhance the perception of intimacy, Maethor is deliberately using the formal form of "you." She wants to highlight that they aren't as close as Coran would like them to be...)

      dî tithen
      Little lady

*Coran's song was written and translated by me. In the event that someone thinks the verse is worthwhile, it may be used by anyone provided they acknowledge the source. I humbly request that anyone who wishes to comment or correct my grammar feel free to email me.

      May we speak as friends, Kivan? Please? (She's requesting they signal the shift to friendship by using the        informal pronoun "you" instead of the formal. Mostly because she wants advice about her love-life.)

      If it pleases you. What do you want?

Note: Because Maethor, Coran, and Kivan are all from communities of elves that remained in Faerun after the Retreat, they speak Tolkien's post-exile equivalent dialect of "low" elvish (Sindarin) ("low" in this case does not imply that the language is inferior to "high"... It merely designates one dialect as more commonly heard/used in Faerun. Similarly, "low" Drowish is the language of trade most commonly used between Drow and Surfacers. "High" Drow is reserved for use between Drow in the Underdark proper... When Maethor praises Drizzt, she attempts to impress him by showing off her knowledge of "high" Drow.) 

I've made a deliberate attempt to translate their conversation into Sindarin. Some of the shorter phrases and exclamations are taken from website sources and some of their discussion is my own attempt at creating original Sindarin dialogue. 

Xan, given that he is from Evereska, one of the more reclusive elvish communities, speaks the Tolkien equivalent dialect of "high" elvish (Quenya) with Maethor in their dialogues. Again, some of the phrases are from web sources and some are original. 

Drowish, both "high" and "low" was a different matter. Almost all the dialogue between Maethor and Viconia and Maethor and Drizzt are original. Only one sentence: 'ulu z'hin' comes from online sources. My apologies for the nature of the insults between Maethor and Viconia. Their mutual "hate at first sight" is reflected in their crude references. What is interesting, however, is that Maethor refuses to speak "low" Drowish with Viconia. All of her insults are in her native tongue while Viconia counters with "low" Drowish, since they have already figured out that each has sufficient understanding of each others' languages to make and receive insults.

I welcome corrections and comments for the Sindarin, Quenya, and Drowish dialogue!! tibicina@live.com.

Talk #5 (Maethor's poem) is based on a madrigal written by Thomas Morley and published in 1594. The original lyrics are as follows:
April is in my mistress' face,
And July in her eyes hath place;
Within her bosom is September,
But in her heart a cold December.

The sonnets from Garrick and Maethor's banter are both by Shakespeare: (20) from Romeo and Juliet, Act I, Scene V, (21) Sonnet CXXVII.

Maethor's Spell

Augment Artistry
(Pr 1; Alteration)
Sphere: Creation
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell combines magic with the act of creation to enhance the artistry of any work created by the recipient of this spell. For every three levels of experience of the priest (round up), the recipient of this spell receives a +1 bonus, to a maximum of +3, to his or her next nonweapon proficiency check against an ability requiring artistic ability. While the effects of this spell last only until the next such nonweapon proficiency check, the results of the augmented artistry are permanent.

In addition to the nonweapon proficiency artistic ability, this spell usually augments a proficiency check for dancing, gem cutting, singing, or any other skill that is traditionally considered an artistic endeavor. This spell does not affect traditional crafts where functionality is emphasized over artistry, including nonweapon proficiencies such as armorer, blacksmithing, leatherworking, seamstress/tailor, weaving, or weaponsmithing, unless the proficiency check is specifically for the esthetic appeal of the finished product. In all cases, the applicability of this enchantment to a particular endeavor is adjudicated by the DM, The material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a scroll bearing a piece of epic poetry (not necessarily the original work).
