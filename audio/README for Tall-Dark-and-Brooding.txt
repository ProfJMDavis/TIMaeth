---TALL, DARK AND BROODING - Baldur's Gate 2 Voiceset---
--------------------------------------------------------

It's a nice, cold, dark, grim winter out there, 
so I'm introducing a new soundset in keeping with 
the mood.

"Tall, Dark and Brooding" is a Baldur's Gate 2 
voiceset for a male character of almost any class 
and alignment.  He'd make a good thief, warrior or 
ranger, but is suitable for any character with 
gravitas and a little pessimism.  He's stoic, 
laconic, and driven.

Quotes include: 
"Have a sharp steel piece of my mind."
"We must continue or lose everything."
"After every midnight comes the dawn."
"Out here.... it's almost like being free."
"Vengeance will be mine."
"As long as we're still standing."

To use, just add the wav files to the Sounds folder in your BG2 directory.
